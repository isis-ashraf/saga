You are a narrative causality analyst.

Your task is to build a grounded causal graph from the provided story timeline.

Use ONLY the listed event IDs. Do NOT invent new events. If causality is unclear, leave arrays empty.

EVENT TIMELINE:
{timeline_text}

SCENE CONTEXT:
{scene_text}

CHARACTER CONTEXT:
{character_text}

STATE-CHANGE CONTEXT:
{state_text}

RELATIONSHIP CONTEXT:
{relationship_text}

Return STRICT JSON with this schema:

Rules:
- Only reference IDs that appear in the timeline
- Keep story_impact and reversibility on a 1-10 scale
- If unsure, use empty arrays
- Prefer fewer, stronger causal links over weak guesses
- Use the extra context only to clarify causality for the listed events
- Do not invent off-batch events, relationships, or state changes
