        - Do not include relationships
        - Do not include entity states
        - Do not include alias maps
        - "characters" means only consequential participants in the event
        - A character may be:
          - a named person
          - a role-based but story-relevant figure
          - a sentient nonhuman being with meaningful agency in the event
        - Include a character only if they act, speak, decide, are directly addressed, or are a meaningful target of the event
        - Do not include background or inconsequential entities
        - Exclude incidental animals, prey, scenery, objects, crowds, and generic background groups unless they are clearly story-relevant participants in that specific event
        - If no consequential character is clearly involved, return an empty characters list for that event
        - Use only these event types:
          action, interaction, movement, discovery
